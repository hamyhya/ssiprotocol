    "The TYRON Network enables people to manage their digital identities, proving who they are without intermediaries. This functionality gets achieved by anchoring Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on blockchain platforms as a shared root of trust. With these technologies, we can have legitimacy as users without handing over the control of our data to a centralized authority or third parties. With TYRON, you can become the owner of your identity and financial assets.": "The TYRON Network enables people to manage their digital identities, proving who they are without intermediaries.

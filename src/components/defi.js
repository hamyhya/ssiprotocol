                <p>SSI gas stations will exist for the self-sovereign identities to buy gas (e.g. AR) from them, provided by SSI Agents.</p>
                <p>Gas stations will only accept $TYRON as means of payment. Fees will also get paid in $TYRON:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SSI Agents can charge a fee</li>
                    <li>The protocol could charge a fee and burn it to reduce the circulating supply of $TYRON</li>
                </ul>

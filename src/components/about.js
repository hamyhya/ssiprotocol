					The word <i>tyron</i> derives from the Greek <i>turannos</i>
					, meaning ’sovereign’. The purpose of the Tyron Self-Sovereign Identity Protocol is to 
					give people sovereignty over their data. Sovereignty to empower our world and to enhance our security online.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tyron Pungtas is a private limited company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore to comply with the legal
					requirements for the protection of our community.
				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</h3>
				<p>
					The Tyron SSI Protocol enables people like you to manage your digital, online identities, proving who you are
					without a middleman. This is achieved by anchoring <Link to="/did">decentralized identifiers</Link> on blockchain 
					networks as a shared root of trust. With this technology, we can have legitimacy as users without giving
					our data to a centralized authority that owns our information. Thus, the Tyron SSI Protocol empowers you to become
					the sovereign owner of your online identity and data assets.
				</p>
				<p>
				Specifically, Tyron develops open-source, decentralized applications such as the <Link to="/wallets">DID smart contract wallet</Link>.
				And it will also provide other products and services for self-sovereign identities.

						The word <i>tyron</i> derives from the Greek <i>turannos</i>
						, meaning â€™sovereignâ€™. The purpose of the Tyron Self-Sovereign Identity Protocol is to 
						give people sovereignty over their data. Sovereignty to empower our world and to enhance our security online.
						Through our community and business model as a profit-sharing community, we want to invest in mitigating climate
						change and in other projects that seek to make our future brighter.
					</p>
				<h3 class="major">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</h3>
					<p>
						Self-Sovereign Identity enables people like you to manage their digital, online identities, proving who they are
						without a middleman. This is achieved by anchoring <Link to="/did">decentralized identifiers</Link> on blockchain 
						networks as a shared root of trust. With this technology, we can have legitimacy as users but without giving away 
						our data to a centralised authority that owns our information. Thus, in the Tyron network, you become the sovereign 
						owner of your online identity and data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Specifically, Tyron develops web portals that are open-source software such as <Link to="/wallets">wallets</Link> and the
						<a href="https://ssibrowser.com"> SSI Browser</a>. Through these portals, self-sovereign identities can share public 
						and encrypted data, as well as make donations to aid natural and human-made disasters that endanger our planetâ€™s ecosystems.
